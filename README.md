## Project Details

This project investigates the feasibility of on-chain verification for VOLE in the Head (VOLE itH), a publicly verifiable and efficient variant of VOLE-based zk proofs. While VOLE-based ZK systems significantly reduce computational complexity for provers, the challenge lies in implementing cost-effective and scalable on-chain verification.

VOLE-based ZK systems are typically designed for efficient prover but are not yet widely implemented for on-chain verification due to challenges such as proof size, communication costs, and gas costs.
 VOLE itH introduces public verifiability, making it a promising candidate for practical zk schemes for on-chain applications via client-side provers. However, the exact costs and technical bottlenecks of integrating VOLE itH into a public blockchain, such as Ethereum, remain unclear.
